# Rustem Ipsum
A lorem ipsum generator that takes a newline seperated file
of quotes or sayings and returns random quotes and paragraphs of
quotes.

Currently, a paragraph returns between 6-11 random quotes. 
Making this count configurable is planned.

## Examples
Get a single quote
`cargo run --example get_quote`

Get a paragraph of quotes
`cargo run --example get_paragraph`

Get 5 paragraphs of quotes
`cargo run --example get_multiple_paragraphs`
